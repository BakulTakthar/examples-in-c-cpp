Subject: Request for Obtaining Documents

Dear Janus Koncepts,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to kindly request the return of the documents I require on leaving your corporation.

Now that i have left your organisation according to the process of leaving i now require various documents such as Relieving Letter, Three Month salary slip and Expirience Letter. These documents are important for my personal records and future reference.

Since I have moved on from the company, I would greatly appreciate it if you could arrange for the safe transfer of these documents to me.

Please let me know the necessary steps I need to take to facilitate the return of these documents. Your assistance in this matter would be highly valued and will help ensure that I have all the necessary documentation in order.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Prateek Takthar
